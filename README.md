# Byte 

## What is Byte?:

Byte is my custom linux distro. "***why*** create another new distro?" 
I'm glad you asked; essentially I want this to be a learning experiance for myself, 
as well as one of, if not the most transparent distro out there. 
I will provide all the devlogs and 0 closed source BS.
Everything will be out in the open for you to audit yourself, or build yourself like linux prides on.

## Package Managment:

I aim to build my own package manager as well, just to make use of the entire LFS experiance.
After excessive testing & building on my own machines, 
I aim to build a more well-rounded kernel for the iso for all of you to install for yourselves. 
I'd like to at least have the basics able to be installed such as:
    * your favorite text editor 
    * steam + proton
    * graphics drivers 
    * language support
    * and much more...

I also want to give you as much range for desktops as I can provide OTB for all of you to test for yourselves. 
All these packages will be provided as soon as I start working on my package managment solution 
(most of the devlogs will be around this and kernel development once I get into all that).

## What is Linux?

For those who are just now finding out about linux I am here to tell you it's an escape from Windows, 
for those who are fed up with them, but it's also freedom of choice if you'd prefer to customize it to your liking. 
Unlike Mac & Windows it is **YOURS** you own it! 
"Yea that's cool... but what ***can't*** it do?" It can do a lot, but it's not without limitations:
    * Linux can't run some games with anti-cheat enabled.
    * Linux can experiance lag at times in the most random of places even if you have all the RAM.
    * It's not for everyone, but for those who are willing to give it a shot there's some guidelines 
        I want to go over with you before you start.

## Choosing a Distro:

This will include those guidelines to help you decide exactly what you *need* based on your own personal prefrences. 
For example: if you need certain software to do your job i.e. Adobe's suite then it's probably not for you. 
This is because the only *good* option that has a shot is Krita,
and from someone that uses it a lot I can tell you it's got a long way to go to be a comparison to photoshop. 
As for video editing I personally use Kdenlive, it's not perfect, but it's free and easy to use. 
We also have access to Davincii Resolve.

As for what distro to pick consider this:
    * If you want up-to-date packages use something like Fedora -> it can do everything 
        Debian & Ubuntu can without being super behind on updates.
    * If you just want to browse the web, and answer emails then 
        Ubuntu or Debian are great options for you.
    * If you want to ***REALLY*** learn linux then 
        I'd suggest Arch or Gentoo **WARNING:** these both require a lot of reading and learning to use effectively. 
        I **DO NOT** recommend them for beginners, 
        but feel free if you like a challenge (virtual machines exist for a reason **USE THEM**).
    * If you're into ethical hacking in any way shape or form then use Kali or Parrot as both are built for that purpose.

We can really ignore most other distros including mine as it's still in development. 
Once I have the beta ready to go I will let you all know. 
I want to nuke my arch install a few times and build something I am personally proud to call my own. 
Once I do that we can start having fun with learning kernel development & 
hopefully at some point in the distant future we can sell our own laptops pre-loaded with linux at an affordable price.

## How Will You Pay for This?:

I'm glad you asked; I am aiming to put all ad revenue & 
if I start streaming all donations towards running this project as my main job. Until then however,
I will be doing this in my spare time every single day after work & on my days off.
